Refresher exercise for Codility code test

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me about the role. I enjoyed learning more about SimpliSafe as a company from the perspective of a candidate, in addition to the perspective I have as a customer.

When my spouse and I purchased our home a couple of years ago, we decided SimpliSafe was the system that was right for us. We trusted you to keep our family safe. Due to a threat outside of our home about a year ago, we decided to double our protection. The night the additional products were connected, my spouse was able to sleep the whole night for the first time in a month. Since then, SimpliSafe water monitors have also alerted us to water under our garbage disposal and near our washing machine. This undoubtedly has saved us from costly repairs. SimpliSafe works and makes a difference in people's lives!

FAQ
*So why is dark mode only changing part of the screen to the indicated background color?*
Typically, I have always used `flex:1` for each screen which takes up the whole screen. Since the code test indicated that the only style to be applied to the root is `backgroundColor`, I opted to stay true to the prompt.

All that said, I have never supported dark mode and know that there are better ways to go about doing this. Which is a great learning exercise. Depending on when you're reading this, I plan on learning more about this and will revisit this project in the future.

*But... 30 minutes is part of the point. Why didn't your code compile?*
In my previous role, I only worked with React Native app about 5% of the time, and haven't touched it at all in the last 8 months. Additionally, within this 2023 job search, SimpliSafe is the first company which has used RN in a code test. I absolutely *love* that you value the skills that will be used most, but this also factored into my less than stellar assessment. 

When starting out, I read through the first couple of tasks and gauged what could be accomplished in the time I had left. My estimation was wrong. While this is not a polished app, I plan on revisiting this over the coming days to brush up my skills.
